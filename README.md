## Features

-   Supports every version of the game - Kula World, Roll Away, Kula Quest, and any other previous versions.
-   Supports both the extraction and creation of **.PAK** and **.KUB** files.
-   Supports [LZRW3-A](http://www.ross.net/compression/lzrw3a.html) compressed files in the alpha version of the game.
-   Supports [text files](#using-text-files) that can control precise ordering of files in large archives.

## Usage

More detailed information is available [here](https://docs.kula.quest/tools/quilt).

### Installation

The latest pre-compiled binaries are available for download on the [releases page](https://github.com/KulaWorkshop/Quilt/releases).

### Archives

To extract an archive file, use the **unpack** command followed by the path to the file and an output folder for its contents.
The following example command will extract the files inside of `HIRO.PAK` into a folder called `levels`:

```bash
$ quilt unpack "HIRO.PAK" "levels"
```

To create an archive, use the **pack** command followed by the path to create it and a list of files to use:

```bash
$ quilt pack "LEVELS.PAK" "LEVEL_1" "LEVEL_2" "LEVEL_3"
```

By default, Quilt will create a **.PAK** file.
Use the `-k` flag to set the creation type to **.KUB**:

```bash
$ quilt pack -k "LEVELS.KUB" "LEVEL_1" "LEVEL_2" "LEVEL_3"
```

### Using Text Files

When dealing with archives that contain many files, or for quick rebuilding of an archive after making adjustments to its contents, you can use a text file containing the files that you would like to use and their order.
You can generate this text file automatically when unpacking an archive, using the `-s` flag:

```bash
$ quilt unpack -s "HIRO.PAK" "levels"
```

This example command will unpack the contents of `HIRO.PAK`, and will additionally save a text file inside of the `levels` folder named `HIRO.PAK.txt`:

```
LEVEL 1
LEVEL 2
LEVEL 3
LEVEL 4
LEVEL 5
LEVEL 6
LEVEL 7
LEVEL 8
LEVEL 9
LEVEL 10
LEVEL 11
LEVEL 12
LEVEL 13
LEVEL 14
LEVEL 15
BONUS 1
BONUS 2
BONUS 3
HIDDEN 1
LESSON
```

The text file format is simple â€” one filename per line, in the order they should appear in the archive.
Instead of having to specify all of these files to build an archive, you can use the **@** parameter following the path of the text file:

```bash
$ quilt pack "HIRO.PAK" "@levels/HIRO.PAK.txt"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that your files are inside the same folder as the text file.

### Alpha Compression

In the first demo of the game, the [.TGI](https://docs.kula.quest/formats/tgi) and [.GGI](https://docs.kula.quest/formats/ggi) files are both fully compressed using the [**lzrw3a**](http://www.ross.net/compression/lzrw3a.html) algorithm.
Quilt allows you to decompress and recompress these files using the following examples below.

For decompression, the following commands can be used:

```bash
$ quilt decompress "KULA.TGI" "KULA.decompressed.TGI"
$ quilt decompress "KULA.GGI" "KULA.decompressed.GGI"
```

If you would like to recompress the file to put it back into the game, you can use another command:

```bash
$ quilt compress "KULA.decompressed.TGI KULA.TGI"
$ quilt compress "KULA.decompressed.GGI KULA.GGI"
```
